# AtmProgram2022
Goal:
The goal for this project is to create an ATM program that takes user input, (Client credentials) and creates different types of bank accounts. The type of account will be largely based on what the user inputs, and will be validated by a group of algorithms inside of an interface class. When the account is created it will be injected with methoods to do basic ATM logic.
